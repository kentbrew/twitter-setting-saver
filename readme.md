# Twitter Setting Saver

We're checking https://twitter.com/home for the presence of an Aria label indicating that Twitter has returned us to the "Home" view.

If we find it, we pause briefly, look for another Aria label for role="menuitem", and click it if we find it.

If you're not an English speaker this won't work because the Aria label for your language will be different. You can help by adding a messages.json file for  your language!
